Breeze & Elementary OS icon set for GNOME and KDE Plasma.

Best results with   opendesktop-dark-gtk   -   https://www.gnome-look.org/p/1501052

The image is taken from the OpenDesktop-Dark Global Theme (https://store.kde.org/p/1484021), which automatically installs also this icon set.

KDE Plasma users may go to System Settings, Appearance, Icons, Get New Icons..., search for OpenDesktop-Icons and apply it.
Non-KDE Plasma users may download and unzip the compressed file into ~/.icons (create .icons folder if it doesn't exists in your home); then apply it depending on your system (e.g. on Ubuntu use Tweaks) 

Based on the following work:
